One party (the debtor) receives something from another party (the creditor or secured party) without paying immediately. 1.3. To ensure the debtor will pay eventually, the debtor gives the creditor rights to a piece of the debtor's property as collateral (a security interest). 2. Security interest and collateral 2.1. A security interest is a right given to the creditor in the debtor's property. 2.2. Collateral is the property in which the creditor obtains rights. 2.3. The security interest allows the creditor to take or sell the collateral if the debtor fails to fulfill the credit obligation (for example, does not pay the creditor). 2.4. The arrangement is usually memorialized in a security agreement. 3. Attaching and perfecting security interests 3.1. Attachment is the process by which collateral is used to secure the creditor's interest. Effect: Once a security interest attaches, the creditor has a right to take the collateral if the debtor defaults. 3.2. Perfection is the process by which the creditor secures her rights in the collateral as against third parties. When third parties also have an interest in the same collateral, the creditor must perfect her security interest to have priority over those third parties.",

The arrangement is usually documented in a security agreement. Attachment is the process by which the security interest becomes enforceable against the debtor in the collateral, giving the creditor the right to seize the collateral on default.

The debtor receives value from the creditor or secured party without immediate payment and grants the creditor a security interest in identified collateral. A security interest is the creditor’s right in the debtor’s property, and the collateral is the property subject to that right. If the debtor defaults, the security interest allows the creditor to take or sell the collateral, typically under the terms of a written security agreement. Attachment is the process by which the security interest becomes effective in the collateral as to the debtor, giving the creditor an enforceable right to the collateral upon default. Perfection is a separate process—such as filing or possession—that secures the creditor’s rights in the collateral as against third parties, ensuring priority over competing claimants to the same collateral.",

Attached vs. unattached/unsecured interests: 2.1 An attached security interest prevails over a mere unsecured or unattached interest. 2.2 Beware scenarios where someone has signed a security agreement but the secured party has not yet given value or the debtor has no rights in the collateral—attachment has not yet occurred, so priority may fail. 3. Perfected vs. unperfected security interests: 3.1 A perfected security interest prevails over an unperfected security interest. 3.2 This rule applies even if the perfected party took its interest with knowledge of an earlier unperfected interest. 4. Perfected vs. perfected security interests: 4.1 As between conflicting perfected security interests, the \"first to file or perfect\" rule applies: the party that first either files a financing statement or otherwise perfects its interest has priority. 4.2 When there are conflicting perfected SIs, priority goes to the party that first filed or perfected (usually the first to file). 4.3 Where collateral is not subject to filing (or cannot be perfected by filing), the first to perfect obtains priority. 4.4 Knowledge of a prior unperfected SI does not prevent a prospective secured party from filing first to obtain priority under the first-to-file-or-perfect rule.",

First, an attached security interest beats an unsecured or unattached interest, so the secured party must have given value and the debtor must have rights in the collateral. Second, a perfected security interest always prevails over an unperfected one, even if the perfected party knew of the earlier unperfected interest.

An attached security interest prevails over an unsecured or merely inchoate interest, but attachment requires a security agreement, value, and the debtor’s rights in the collateral—if any of these are missing, the would-be secured party has no priority. Between security interests, perfection is critical: a perfected security interest defeats an unperfected one even if the perfected creditor had knowledge of the earlier unperfected interest. When both interests are perfected, the default rule is first-to-file-or-perfect: the creditor that first files a financing statement covering the collateral or otherwise perfects (whichever occurs first) takes priority. For collateral not subject to filing, the first creditor to actually perfect has priority. Knowledge of prior unperfected security interests does not bar a later creditor from filing first and thereby gaining priority under the first-to-file-or-perfect rule.",

The debtor may recover actual damages designed to put her in the position she would have occupied had there been no violation. If the collateral is consumer goods, the debtor is also entitled to statutory minimum damages of at least 10% of the cash price of the goods plus the interest charges due over the life of the loan. In addition, noncompliance can affect the secured party’s right to a deficiency judgment. In non-consumer transactions, most jurisdictions apply the rebuttable presumption rule, presuming the value of the seized collateral equals the debt unless the secured party proves a lower value. In consumer transactions, courts follow one of three approaches: (1) apply the rebuttable presumption rule; (2) deny the secured party any deficiency judgment; or (3) permit a deficiency but reduce it by the amount of actual damages the debtor can prove.",

      "hardContent": "Article 9’s interstate rules begin with a general principle: when either the debtor or the collateral moves to another state, a security interest that was perfected under the law of the original state remains temporarily perfected, giving the secured party time to adjust to the new jurisdiction. Specifically, the interest stays perfected for a limited period; if the secured party does not perfect in the new state within that time, the security interest becomes unperfected and loses its original priority date as against competing claimants. In the particular case of debtor relocation, a security interest perfected under the original state’s law remains perfected for four months after the debtor moves. To maintain continuous perfection and preserve the original priority date, the secured party must file or otherwise perfect under the law of the new debtor’s state before that four‑month period expires; failure to do so results in loss of perfection and priority.",

      "mediumContent": "Article 9 preserves perfection when collateral perfected by possession or certificate‑of‑title goods move across state lines. For collateral perfected by a possessory security interest, moving the collateral to a new state does not automatically destroy perfection; the security interest remains perfected as long as possession of the collateral would constitute perfection under the law of the new state. For vehicles or other goods covered by a certificate of title, if the goods are taken to another state and that state issues a new certificate of title, the secured party’s original perfected security interest continues for as long as it would have lasted if no new certificate of title had been issued in the new state.",
      "hardContent": "When collateral perfected by possession or certificate‑of‑title goods move interstate, Article 9 supplies specific continuity rules. If collateral located in one state is perfected by a possessory security interest and is then moved to a different state, the security interest remains perfected so long as possession of the collateral would perfect the interest under the laws of the new state. Thus, the critical question is whether the new state also recognizes perfection by possession for that type of collateral. For cars, vehicles, and other certificate‑of‑title goods, when the goods are moved to another state and that state issues a new certificate of title, the original perfected security interest does not automatically lapse. Instead, it continues for as long as it would have continued had the new certificate of title not been issued, preserving the original secured party’s perfection despite the new documentation.",

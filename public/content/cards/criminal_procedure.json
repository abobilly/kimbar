(2) Inventory searches—when an arrestee is taken to jail, officers may inventory his belongings or other seized property, including impounded vehicles, pursuant to standardized, good-faith procedures. (3) Vehicle searches incident to arrest—after arresting a recent occupant, officers may search the vehicle’s passenger compartment, including containers and the glove box, if at the time of the search the arrestee is unsecured and can reach the interior, or if it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest; the trunk may not be searched incident to arrest absent probable cause (e.g., supporting an automobile-exception search) or consent.

An accused may terminate a custodial interrogation at any time by invoking: 1.1.1. The right to remain silent; or 1.1.2. The Fifth Amendment right to counsel. 2. Two main forms of invocation 2.1. Invoking the right to remain silent requires police to cease questioning, with limited ability to later reinitiate. 2.2. Invoking the Fifth Amendment right to counsel requires police to stop all questioning on any topic unless the accused reinitiates and validly waives. 3. Waiver of Miranda rights 3.1. Any waiver must be knowing and voluntary, proven by the prosecution by a preponderance of the evidence. 3.2. Waiver may be express or implied from conduct. 4. Independent Fourteenth Amendment voluntariness requirement 4.1. Regardless of Miranda, due process requires that confessions be voluntary under the totality of the circumstances (e.g., age, condition, education, and interrogation conditions).",

The prosecutor presents evidence in secret proceedings, and the grand jury votes whether to indict. These proceedings operate under special rules: the suspect typically cannot attend or confront witnesses, and ordinary trial-based protections for witnesses are limited or altered. At the same time, witnesses retain the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and may be compelled to testify through grants of immunity. The exclusionary rule does not apply at this stage, so even unlawfully obtained evidence can support an indictment.

In analyzing a search, first ask whether there was a valid warrant; if so, the search is usually reasonable, subject to scope and execution limits. If there is no valid warrant, the search is presumed unreasonable unless it fits within an established exception: search incident to arrest, plain view, automobile search, valid consent, exigent circumstances, or stop and frisk, remembered by the mnemonic \"SPACE-S.\"",
      "hardContent": "The Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness requirement ordinarily demands a valid search warrant, supported by probable cause and issued by a neutral and detached magistrate, with proper description of the place to be searched and items to be seized. In practice, the analysis is a two-step inquiry: (1) Was there a valid search warrant? If yes, the search will typically be upheld, provided officers remained within the scope of the warrant and executed it properly. (2) If there was no valid warrant, the search is presumptively unreasonable. The government can overcome this presumption only by establishing that the search falls within a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. The primary exceptions to keep in mind at the framework level are: search incident to arrest, plain view, automobile search, valid consent, exigent circumstances (such as hot pursuit or risk of destruction of evidence), and stop and frisk. These are captured by the mnemonic \"SPACE-S.\"",

      "mediumContent": "In grand jury proceedings, witnesses may refuse to answer incriminating questions by invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege. Prosecutors can respond by granting immunity—most commonly use or derivative-use immunity—which bars the government from using the compelled testimony or its fruits against the witness in later prosecutions (other than for perjury). The exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings, so an indictment can be based on evidence that would be inadmissible at trial due to constitutional violations, with the remedy being suppression of that evidence at trial rather than dismissal of the indictment.",
      "hardContent": "The Fifth Amendment continues to protect witnesses in the grand jury context. Any witness may invoke the privilege against self-incrimination to avoid answering questions that may reasonably expose them to criminal liability. To overcome this, prosecutors may grant immunity—constitutionally, use and derivative-use immunity suffices, meaning the government cannot use the compelled statements or any evidence directly or indirectly derived from them against the witness in a subsequent criminal case, except in prosecutions for perjury or false statements. At the same time, the usual trial remedy for constitutional violations—the exclusionary rule—does not operate at the grand jury stage. Courts permit grand juries to consider evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments, and will not dismiss an otherwise valid indictment merely because it relies on illegally obtained evidence. The typical remedy is suppression of that evidence at trial, not invalidation of the indictment.",

The usual remedies include specific performance (e.g., resentencing before a different judge in accordance with the bargain) or allowing withdrawal of the plea. However, the trial judge is not bound to accept the plea or to impose the recommended sentence, because the judge is not a contracting party.

      "mediumContent": "The Bruton rule limits the use, at a joint jury trial, of a co-defendant’s confession that incriminates another defendant, because the non-confessing defendant cannot effectively confront the out-of-court accusatory statement. Such a confession is generally inadmissible against the other defendant when offered before a jury, though it may be considered by a judge at a bench trial. The confrontation problem is cured if the confessing co-defendant testifies and is subject to cross-examination; if the defendants are tried separately so the confession is presented only against the confessor; if the confession is redacted to eliminate all references that would reasonably identify the co-defendant; or if the confession is used solely to rebut the defendant’s claim that his own confession was coerced.",

A co-defendant’s confession that facially or directly implicates another defendant is generally inadmissible against that defendant at a joint jury trial because the confessing co-defendant is not on the stand for cross-examination and the jury cannot realistically follow a limiting instruction to consider the confession only against the speaker. However, if the trial is conducted before a judge (a bench trial), the judge is presumed to consider the confession only against the confessor, so Bruton does not bar its use. The confrontation problem is resolved, and the confession may be admitted, if: (1) the confessing co-defendant takes the stand and is subject to cross-examination; (2) the trials are severed so that the confession is not placed before a jury evaluating a non-confessing co-defendant; (3) the confession is effectively redacted so that it no longer identifies or obviously points to the other defendant; or (4) the confession is admitted solely to rebut the defendant’s argument that his own confession was coerced, not as direct proof of his guilt.",

This constitutional requirement applies on top of the rules of evidence.

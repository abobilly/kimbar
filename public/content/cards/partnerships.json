A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a partnership in which the partners’ potential for personal liability is limited by statute. A limited partnership (LP) is a partnership with different levels of partners, typically at least one general partner, who manages and has personal liability, and at least one limited partner, who has limited liability and usually no management authority. The partnership rules discussed on these cards generally apply to all partnership types unless otherwise noted. These are default rules that can be modified by a valid partnership agreement, subject to mandatory statutory limits.",

Partnership property includes capital contributed by each partner and all property owned by or purchased with partnership funds. Title in the partnership name or purchase with partnership funds strongly indicates partnership property, and courts may also look at how the property is used, recorded, and maintained. 2. Partners’ Interest in Property – Who owns specific assets? The partnership, as an entity, owns partnership property. Individual partners have no separate ownership interest in specific partnership assets, and their personal creditors cannot directly reach partnership property to satisfy individual debts. Instead, partners hold an economic/transferable interest. 3. Profits, Losses, and Management – Default economic and control rights. Each partner has a transferable interest consisting of her share of profits and losses and the right to receive distributions. Absent agreement, partners share profits (and thus losses) equally and have equal rights in management of the partnership business.",

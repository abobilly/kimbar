The decedent's will is denied probate (for example, the will is successfully contested or improperly executed). 2. Varying statutory schemes: 2.1. States have varying rules for how a decedent's assets are distributed through intestate succession (i.e., who is entitled to the assets and in what amounts). 2.2. Because of this variation, exam questions involving intestate distribution often provide the text of a hypothetical statute governing asset distribution. 3. Terminology: 3.1. Heir vs. beneficiary: An heir is one who takes by intestate succession; a beneficiary is one named in a will or trust. 3.2. Issue and descendants: These terms are often used interchangeably to describe heirs or lineal descendants of the decedent. 3.3.

      "mediumContent": "Intestate succession is the statutory scheme for distributing a decedent’s assets not disposed of by will, such as when there is no will, when gifts fail or there is no residuary clause, or when the will is denied probate due to contest or improper execution. States vary in how they allocate assets, so exam questions often provide a specific intestacy statute.

Issues arise when the decedent dies without a will, when the will fails to dispose of all property (e.g., failed gift or lack of a residuary clause), or when the will is denied probate because it is successfully contested or improperly executed. Because intestacy rules differ across jurisdictions, bar exam questions commonly provide the text of a hypothetical intestacy statute specifying which relatives take and in what shares. Terminology is critical: an heir is someone who takes by intestate succession, whereas a beneficiary is named in a will or trust. The terms “issue” and “descendants” generally refer to the decedent’s lineal descendants and are often used interchangeably. “Devise” and “bequest” refer to testamentary transfers under a will. The “probate estate” consists roughly of the property the decedent owned at death that must pass through probate rather than by non‑probate mechanisms such as joint tenancy or beneficiary designations.",

Thus, a bequest of \"$10,000 to each of my gardeners employed at my death\" is valid even if the testator later fires and hires different gardeners, because employment decisions are presumed to be motivated by ordinary business reasons, not by a desire to manipulate will beneficiaries.

Revocation by physical act occurs when the testator burns, tears, or otherwise destroys the will, or directs someone else to do so in the testator's presence, with present intent to revoke. Most states recognize partial revocation by physical act, such as crossing out or cancelling specific provisions. If cancellation marks appear on a will known to have last been in the testator's possession, a presumption arises that the testator made the marks with the intent to revoke to that extent.",

Relief may be available only if there is a separate ground for contesting the will, such as fraud, duress, or undue influence.

      "hardContent": "A trust is a fiduciary relationship where the settlor transfers legal title to property to a trustee, who holds and manages it for the benefit of equitable owners (beneficiaries). Modern statutes generally make trusts revocable unless the instrument expressly states that the trust is irrevocable. The principal categories are: • Express trusts, which arise from the owner's express intent and include private trusts for defined or ascertainable beneficiaries (created inter vivos or by will) and charitable trusts for an indefinite class or the public. • Resulting trusts, which are implied by law, usually when an express trust fails (e.g., no living beneficiary, void or unenforceable provisions), causing the trustee to hold and convey property back to the settlor or, if deceased, the settlor's estate. • Constructive trusts, which are not true trusts but equitable remedies. A court imposes a constructive trust on property in a wrongdoer’s possession to prevent unjust enrichment from wrongful conduct.",

A support trust directs the trustee to pay only what is necessary for the beneficiary’s support, and creditors typically have the same limited rights as with discretionary trusts. A spendthrift trust includes a clause prohibiting the beneficiary from transferring their trust interest voluntarily or involuntarily, primarily to protect the beneficiary from poor financial decisions; as a result, creditors cannot reach the beneficiary’s trust interest, though they may reach distributions once made. Despite spendthrift or similar restrictions, certain preferred creditors—spousal or child support claimants, providers of basic necessities, and federal or state tax authorities—may reach the trust assets to satisfy their claims.",

Typical situations include failure of an express trust because the named beneficiary is dead, the trust terms are void or unenforceable, or the trust purpose has been completely fulfilled with surplus remaining. In these circumstances, equity presumes that the settlor did not intend the trustee to retain the beneficial interest. The trustee therefore holds the property on a resulting trust for the settlor, and must convey legal title back to the settlor; if the settlor is deceased, the trustee transfers the property to the settlor's estate, for distribution under the will or intestacy.",

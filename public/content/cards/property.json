It is a present fee estate vested in the grantee but subject to divestment if the condition occurs. Creating a defeasible fee requires clear language showing that the estate will end or be forfeited upon a stated event; mere words of desire, hope, or aspiration are not enough. There are three main types of defeasible fees, each paired with a specific future interest: - Fee simple determinable (with a possibility of reverter in the grantor). - Fee simple subject to condition subsequent (with a right of reentry/power of termination in the grantor). - Fee simple subject to an executory interest (with a shifting executory interest in a third party).",

Permissive waste – harm resulting from the LT's neglect, including failure to maintain, repair, or pay taxes and carrying charges, subject to limits based on income or reasonable rental value and reimbursement rights. 3. Ameliorative waste – material changes that increase the property's value; traditionally prohibited at common law but generally permitted in modern jurisdictions, especially where neighborhood conditions have changed and the change increases value.",

Merger (Shelley’s Rule / Rule in Shelley’s Case) - Common law: When a grant was \"to A for life, then to A’s heirs,\" the life estate in A and the remainder in A’s heirs merged in A, giving A a fee simple absolute. - Modern: Shelley’s Rule has been abolished in most jurisdictions. A has a life estate, A’s heirs hold contingent remainders (unascertained while A lives), and O retains a reversion in case A dies without heirs. 3. Doctrine of Worthier Title - Common law: When a grant was \"to A for life, then to O’s heirs,\" a purported future interest in O’s heirs was void; the law presumed that O retained a reversion instead. - Modern: Often treated as a rebuttable rule of construction that can be overcome by clear contrary intent in the instrument.

The Doctrine of Worthier Title applied to grants like \"to A for life, then to O’s heirs\" and voided the future interest in O’s heirs, presuming that O retained a reversion.

Shelley’s Rule (the Rule in Shelley’s Case) applied to conveyances like \"to A for life, then to A’s heirs\" and, at common law, merged A’s life estate and the remainder in A’s heirs into a fee simple absolute in A; modern jurisdictions largely abolish the rule, so A has a life estate, A’s heirs hold contingent remainders because they are unascertained during A’s life, and O retains a reversion if A dies without heirs. The Doctrine of Worthier Title applied when the grantor gave \"to A for life, then to O’s heirs,\" and at common law voided the contingent remainder or executory interest in O’s heirs, presuming that O retained a reversion instead; today the doctrine is often a mere rule of construction that can be overcome by clear contrary intent in the instrument.

      "hardContent": "A joint tenancy is a concurrent ownership estate defined by the four unities of time, title, interest, and possession: joint tenants must acquire their interests at the same time, through the same instrument, hold equal and identical interests, and have equal rights to possess the whole property. The grantor must expressly indicate an intent to create a joint tenancy; otherwise, the default is a tenancy in common. The key feature is the right of survivorship: on the death of a joint tenant, the surviving joint tenants automatically succeed to the deceased tenant's share, making the interest alienable inter vivos but not devisable or descendible. Severance occurs when any joint tenant destroys one of the unities (for example, by selling her interest), which converts that share into a tenancy in common without necessarily destroying the joint tenancy between the remaining tenants. Mortgages have different effects depending on jurisdiction: under the majority lien theory, a mortgage creates only a lien and does not sever the joint tenancy, whereas under the minority title theory, the transfer of title to the mortgagee severs the joint tenancy as to that share.",

Fourth, there must be vertical privity between the original covenanting party and the successor in interest—typically established by transfer through contract, devise, or descent. Vertical privity rules for the benefit are generally more relaxed than for the burden, and, in a majority of states, horizontal privity between the original parties is not required for the benefit to run.",

Distinction from executory interests: 3.1 A contingent remainder must still follow the natural termination of the prior estate and cannot divest a prior transferee. 3.2 If the future interest instead cuts short or divests a prior transferee’s interest (rather than waiting for natural termination), it is an executory interest, not a contingent remainder. 3.3 Put differently, contingent remainders are conditional future interests that \"wait\" for the prior estate to end naturally, while executory interests \"spring\" or \"shift\" by divesting or cutting off an earlier interest.",

A remainder is contingent if: • There is a {{c2::condition precedent}} to the future interest becoming possessory; or • The future interest is given to an {{c3::unascertained or unborn taker}}; or • {{c4::Both}} a condition precedent and an unascertained taker are present. Contingent remainders still {{c5::wait for the natural termination}} of the prior estate and {{c6::do not divest a prior transferee}}.

      "mediumContent": "Contingent remainders arise when a remainder is subject to a condition precedent, is given to an unascertained or unborn person, or both. Although they are conditional or uncertain, they are still remainders: they become possessory, if at all, only when the prior estate naturally ends and they do not divest any prior transferee. By contrast, executory interests operate by cutting off or divesting an earlier interest, so they do not qualify as remainders.",
      "hardContent": "A contingent remainder is any remainder that does not qualify as vested—either because there is an unsatisfied condition precedent to possession, because the taker is unascertained or unborn, or because both are true. For example, \"To A for life, then to B if B graduates from law school\" creates a contingent remainder in B, conditional on graduation. Likewise, a gift \"To A for life, then to A’s first grandchild to reach 21\" is contingent so long as no grandchild has yet satisfied the condition and the taker is unascertained. Crucially, contingent remainders still wait for the natural termination of the prior estate and do not cut short any prior transferee. If the future interest instead operates by divesting or cutting off a prior transferee’s interest—such as \"To A, but if B returns from Rome, then to B\"—the interest is classified as an executory interest (springing or shifting), not as a contingent remainder.",

Partition and sale 2.1 Any co-tenant generally has the right to seek judicial partition of the property, thereby ending the co-tenancy. 2.2 Partition in kind: If feasible, a court prefers to physically divide the property, giving each co-tenant a separate parcel consistent with their interests. 2.3 Partition by sale: If physical division is not practical or would substantially diminish the value of the property, a court may order a sale and apportion the proceeds among co-tenants according to their interests. 3.

A co-tenant can sue another co-tenant for waste if that co-tenant's conduct damages the property, allows it to deteriorate, or materially and improperly alters its character. Jurisdictions typically recognize affirmative waste (voluntary destructive acts such as overharvesting timber or demolishing structures), permissive waste (failure to perform ordinary maintenance or pay charges like taxes leading to deterioration or loss), and, in some jurisdictions, ameliorative waste (unauthorized changes that increase market value but significantly change the property's nature, such as converting a historic residence into commercial space). Waste actions may be brought during the life of the co-tenancy to obtain damages or injunctive relief. As to termination, any co-tenant generally has the right to seek judicial partition. Courts favor partition in kind, physically dividing the property into separate parcels corresponding to the co-tenants' interests when feasible. Where a physical division is impractical, would prejudice the parties, or would substantially reduce the overall value of the land, a court may instead order partition by sale and then apportion the sale proceeds among the co-tenants according to their fractional interests. Co-tenants may agree by contract not to partition, but such non-partition agreements are enforceable only if they are limited to a reasonable period and serve legitimate ends (such as maintaining family property or facilitating a business venture).

Consequently, the sublessee is not directly liable to the landlord for rent or other lease covenants unless the sublessee expressly assumes those obligations in an agreement that the landlord can enforce (e.g., as a third-party beneficiary).",

Stream of commerce: Manufacturers who put goods into the stream of commerce may be subject to jurisdiction if they could reasonably expect consumers in the forum state to purchase their products; mere awareness that component parts may reach the forum as part of another product is insufficient. 3.

However, a cross-claim is never compulsory, even if it arises from the same transaction or occurrence; the party may choose whether to assert it. There must be an independent basis for subject-matter jurisdiction over the cross-claim, but this is typically supplied by supplemental jurisdiction given the common nucleus of operative fact.",

Rule 23(b)(2) classes are appropriate where the defendant has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, making final injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief appropriate for the class as a whole; these typically arise in civil rights and employment discrimination cases where the primary relief is injunctive or declaratory, not damages.

Requests for production (FRCP 34): Written requests that require a party to make documents, electronically stored information, or other tangible items in its control available for inspection, copying, or review, generally with 30 days to respond; non-parties must be compelled by subpoena. 3. Requests for admission (FRCP 36): Written requests that ask a party to admit the truth of facts, the application of law to fact, or the genuineness of documents. Admissions conclusively establish the matter for the litigation and must be answered (admit, deny, or state lack of knowledge after reasonable inquiry) within 30 days. 4. Physical or mental examinations (FRCP 35): Available only by court order when a person's physical or mental condition is in controversy and good cause is shown. When ordered, the usual doctor–patient confidentiality for that condition is effectively waived for purposes of the case. All four devices are aimed at facilitating efficient fact development and narrowing issues for trial, often with a 30‑day response period unless the court orders otherwise.",

The party has 30 days after service to respond or object, and non-parties can be compelled only through subpoena. • Requests for admission (Rule 36): Written requests that a party admit the truth of discoverable information, including facts, the application of law to fact, or the genuineness of documents. Matters admitted are conclusively established for the action and need not be proven at trial. A party has 30 days to respond by admitting, denying, or stating, after reasonable inquiry, that it cannot truthfully admit or deny. • Physical or mental examinations (Rule 35): A discovery device available only by court order when a person’s physical or mental condition is in controversy and the movant demonstrates good cause. Once ordered, the usual doctor–patient privilege concerning that condition is effectively waived for purposes of the litigation, allowing disclosure and use of the examination results.

Once initiated, discovery is conducted through formal tools: depositions, requests for production of documents or things, interrogatories, and requests for admission.

      "frontPrompt": "What are the requirements for an interlocutory order to be immediately appealable under the collateral order exception?",
      "cloze": "Under the {{c1::collateral order exception}}, an interlocutory order may be immediately appealed if it: 1. Is {{c2::collateral}} – too distinct from the merits of the case; 2. Is too {{c3::important}} to be denied immediate review; and 3. Would essentially be {{c4::unreviewable}} if the parties waited for final judgment.",
      "easyContent": "An interlocutory order can be appealed under the collateral order doctrine if it is separate from the merits, very important, and effectively unreviewable after final judgment.",
      "mediumContent": "The collateral order exception allows immediate appeal of a narrow class of non-final orders when: (1) the order resolves an issue that is collateral to the merits; (2) the issue is sufficiently important that delaying review would be unacceptable; and (3) the order would effectively be unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.",
      "hardContent": "The collateral order doctrine is a narrow exception to the final judgment rule. An interlocutory order qualifies only if it: (1) conclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits (i.e., it is collateral); and (3) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment, such that delaying review would effectively deny the right at stake. In bar-exam shorthand, the order must be collateral to the merits, too important to defer review, and essentially unreviewable later.",

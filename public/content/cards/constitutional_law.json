Ripeness bars claims brought too early, before a law or government act has been implemented enough to create a concrete dispute. Mootness bars claims that become academic after filing—if the plaintiff’s injury has disappeared and no exception applies. Exceptions to mootness include: (1) wrongs capable of repetition but evading review, where the injury ends too quickly to fully litigate yet is likely to recur to the same plaintiff; (2) voluntary cessation by the defendant, where the defendant stops the challenged conduct but remains free to restart; and (3) class actions, where the case can continue so long as at least one class member has an ongoing injury.",

However, a case is not moot where: (1) the wrong is capable of repetition yet evading review, as when the injury ends before the litigation can conclude but the same plaintiff can reasonably expect to face the harm again (e.g., repeated bar exams or pregnancies); (2) the defendant voluntarily ceases the challenged conduct but remains free to resume it; or (3) in class actions, at least one member of the certified class continues to suffer an ongoing injury.",

(2) Methods of review: Most cases reach the Court by discretionary writ of certiorari, which the Court may grant or deny. By contrast, the Court must take mandatory appeals from three-judge federal district court panels deciding injunctive relief, bypassing the courts of appeal. (3) Final judgment and appellate limits: The Court generally reviews only final judgments from lower federal courts or a state’s highest court. Congress may limit the Court’s appellate jurisdiction to certain categories of cases, consistent with Article III, but may not enlarge its original jurisdiction. (4) Adequate and independent state grounds: The Court cannot review state court decisions that rest on an independent and adequate state law ground.

Because the nondelegation doctrine is applied leniently, courts rarely strike down statutes for excessive delegation, so bar‑exam answers that rest solely on “too much delegation” are usually wrong.

In any Equal Protection analysis, first ask whether there is a discriminatory classification; heightened scrutiny applies only if a discriminatory classification is proved. Second, determine the applicable level of scrutiny: suspect classifications get strict scrutiny, quasi-suspect classifications get intermediate scrutiny, and all other alleged classifications get rational basis review. Third, analyze whether the classification satisfies the applicable level of scrutiny.",

For the right to travel, key issues include which durational residency requirements are invalid versus those that are valid.

Right-to-vote issues arise when some citizens are denied the vote or their voting power is diluted.

In both contexts, strict scrutiny applies when a law significantly burdens the right. For the right to travel, a key pattern involves durational residency requirements attached to state benefits or privileges and other laws that impede movement between states, with a distinction between valid and invalid durational rules. For the right to vote, the doctrine focuses on (1) laws denying some citizens the right to vote, (2) the one-person, one-vote requirement in all state and local elections, which demands substantially equal-population districts for elected bodies, and (3) the permissibility of at-large election schemes, which are constitutional so long as they are not adopted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose.",

Second, where a law involves a traditional government function, the Court gives the state more latitude to discriminate in favor of its residents in performing core public functions.

Equal protection analysis applies when the government burdens a right for some people but not others, thereby creating a classification. When a fundamental right (such as privacy, voting, or interstate travel) is burdened, the court typically applies strict scrutiny, requiring that the law be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest. When no fundamental right is implicated, whether the challenge is framed as substantive due process or equal protection, the applicable test is rational basis, which asks only whether the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.",

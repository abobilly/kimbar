Subsequent remedial measures: Inadmissible to prove fault, a defective product or design, or an inadequate warning, but admissible to prove ownership or control when disputed, or to rebut a claim that there was no feasible precaution. 3. Settlements and plea bargaining: In civil cases, compromises, settlement offers, and related statements about a disputed claim are inadmissible to prove liability, fault, or the amount of the claim, and this protection does not apply before any claim or threat of litigation. In criminal cases, pleas, offers to plead, and related statements are inadmissible to prove guilt or punishment. 4.

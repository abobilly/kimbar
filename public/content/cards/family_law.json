Bigamy/polygamy exceptions 2.1 Removal of impediment: Under the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, a bigamous marriage can be validated upon removal of the impediment (i.e., when the prior marriage is terminated). 2.2 Presumption of validity: Under the presumption of validity, the last of several marriages is presumed valid, which may be rebutted by evidence that the prior marriages still persist.",

These agreements can later be amended or revoked only by a written agreement signed by both parties, and amendments do not need new consideration.

Legally, the marriage is treated as if it never occurred. A marriage can be annulled if it is void or voidable (the precise classification varies by state). Common grounds for annulment include bigamy or polygamy, consanguinity (close blood relationship), non-age, incurable physical impotence, and incapacity to consent (e.g., mental incompetence, intoxication, fraud, or duress). On annulment, many states allow temporary spousal support during the suit, though fewer allow ongoing support afterward. Most courts divide property with the aim of placing the parties as nearly as possible in the positions they occupied before the marriage commenced.",

      "mediumContent": "Annulment is a judicial declaration that a marriage was void or voidable because an impediment existed at the time of marriage, so in law the marriage never occurred. Core issues are: (1) identifying qualifying grounds (e.g., bigamy, consanguinity, non-age, impotence, or incapacity to consent); and (2) determining the consequences—temporary versus ongoing spousal support and a property division that generally aims to restore each party to their pre-marriage status.",

A marriage may be annulled if it is void or voidable, though which specific grounds create a void versus a voidable marriage varies by state. The doctrine focuses on three clusters of issues: (1) the legal nature and effect of annulment—that the marriage is considered never to have existed; (2) the recognized grounds, such as bigamy or polygamy, consanguinity, non-age, incurable physical impotence, and incapacity to consent due to mental incompetence, intoxication, fraud, or duress; and (3) the consequences if an annulment is granted, including whether temporary or post-annulment support is available and how property should be divided, with most courts attempting to return the parties as closely as possible to their pre-marriage positions.",

Additionally, each party must have full and fair disclosure of the other’s financial circumstances—assets, liabilities, and income—or must knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to detailed disclosure after having adequate knowledge of the other’s finances.

      "mediumContent": "Status jurisdiction based on domicile lets a state decide whether a couple is married or divorced, but that does not automatically allow the court to divide property or order support. Courts generally cannot adjudicate rights in out-of-state property or enter binding spousal or child support orders without personal jurisdiction over the parties. Thus, fully resolving property division and support typically requires personal jurisdiction over both spouses.",
      "hardContent": "Family law distinguishes between status and economic incidents of marriage. A court may rely solely on domicile to adjudicate marital status, granting or denying a divorce even if it lacks personal jurisdiction over the nonresident spouse. By contrast, property division and support obligations are economic incidents that implicate due process concerns: a court typically cannot determine rights to property located outside the state—especially real property—or impose spousal or child support obligations on an absent party unless it has personal jurisdiction over that party. Consequently, while status can be changed with unilateral domicile-based jurisdiction, comprehensive resolution of economic issues in a marriage dissolution usually requires personal jurisdiction over both spouses.",

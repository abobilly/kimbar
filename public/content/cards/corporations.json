Limited liability: only the corporation itself can be liable for its obligations; shareholders, board members, and officers are generally not personally liable for the corporation's obligations. 3. Transferability of ownership: shareholders can freely transfer their ownership interests (i.e., shares) unless prohibited by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. 4. Continuity: corporations can exist in perpetuity; changes in ownership do not affect the corporation's existence. 5.

      "hardContent": "A corporation is a legal entity distinct from its owners and is characterized by several core attributes. First, management is centralized in a board of directors (BoD), which oversees major decisions and delegates day-to-day operations to corporate officers; unlike partnerships, shareholders do not ordinarily manage. Second, owners and managers enjoy limited liability: the corporation alone is responsible for its debts and obligations, and shareholders, directors, and officers are generally not personally liable. Third, ownership interests—shares—are generally freely transferable unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws impose restrictions. Fourth, corporations have continuity of life and may exist in perpetuity; changes in shareholder ownership do not terminate the entity. Fifth, corporations are treated as legal persons, capable of owning property, suing and being sued, and receiving certain constitutional protections such as due process and equal protection.",

      "hardContent": "A merger is a fundamental corporate transaction in which two or more corporations combine into a single corporation, typically by one surviving corporation absorbing the others. Because mergers are fundamental changes, they ordinarily require both board and shareholder approval, subject to a key exception where the surviving corporation’s articles and shareholders’ rights do not materially change, so its shareholders need not vote. Following a merger, the surviving corporation automatically succeeds to all property and obligations of the constituent corporations. Corporate statutes also authorize short-form mergers when a parent owns at least 90% of a subsidiary’s stock, allowing merger without shareholder approval. Finally, dissenting shareholders are generally entitled to statutory appraisal rights, permitting them, with proper notice and compliance with statutory procedures, to dissent and demand fair market value for their shares instead of participating in the merger.",

Fiduciary duty of loyalty (overview) - Directors must put the corporation’s interests ahead of their own personal interests. - They must avoid self-dealing and conflicts of interest (e.g., transactions in which the director has a material personal financial interest) unless properly disclosed and approved under applicable conflict-of-interest rules. - Directors may not usurp corporate opportunities that rightfully belong to the corporation, and they must refrain from competing unfairly with the corporation. 3.

(Exact triggers vary by statute.) 3. Mutual notice and procedure requirements: 3.1 Corporation’s notice obligations: - Before a vote is taken on the merger, the corporation must give shareholders: • Notice of the shareholders’ meeting at which the merger will be voted on; and • Notice of their appraisal (dissenters’) rights and how to exercise them. 3.2 Shareholders’ obligations to perfect rights: - Shareholders must follow statutory procedures to perfect appraisal rights, which generally include: • Giving timely notice of their intent to dissent; • Not voting in favor of the merger; and • Complying with any additional statutory steps, such as submitting share certificates or written demands. 4. Valuation and payment: 4.1 Corporation’s obligation to pay: - If the merger is approved, the corporation must pay dissenting shareholders the fair market value (FMV) for their shares, as determined under the applicable statute. 4.2 Disputes and judicial determination: - If the shareholder and corporation cannot agree on the FMV, a court (or occasionally an appraiser appointed under statute) will determine the fair value to be paid. 4.3 Nature of the remedy: - Appraisal is typically the shareholder’s exclusive remedy for challenging the price of a merger, absent fraud, illegality, or other serious wrongdoing.",

When a shareholder is entitled to vote on such a transaction and objects, the corporation must, prior to the vote, give formal notice of the meeting and clearly disclose that appraisal rights are available and how they may be exercised. The shareholder must then strictly comply with statutory perfection requirements—typically including giving written notice of intent to dissent before or at the meeting, abstaining from voting in favor of the merger, and completing any additional steps such as depositing share certificates or making a written demand. If the merger is approved, the corporation must pay dissenting shareholders the fair market value of their shares as of the relevant valuation date.

Manager-managed LLCs 2.1 In a manager-managed LLC, only managers owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the LLC and, where applicable, to the members. 2.2 Non-managing members generally do not owe these fiduciary duties simply by virtue of being members. 2.3 The members can ratify a manager’s act that would otherwise violate the duty of loyalty, typically with informed approval under the operating agreement and applicable statute. 3. Good faith and fair dealing 3.1 Regardless of whether the LLC is member-managed or manager-managed, all members and managers have an obligation of good faith and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of the operating agreement. 3.2 This contractual obligation cannot be eliminated, but the operating agreement may define or shape how good faith and fair dealing apply, subject to statutory limits.",

      "easyContent": "In a member-managed LLC, all members owe duties of care and loyalty to each other and to the LLC. In a manager-managed LLC, those fiduciary duties are owed by the managers, not by non-managing members. All members and managers, however, must act in good faith and with fair dealing in carrying out the operating agreement.",
      "mediumContent": "Fiduciary duties in an LLC depend on its management structure. In a member-managed LLC, every member owes duties of care and loyalty to each other and to the LLC. In a manager-managed LLC, only the designated managers owe these duties; non-managing members typically do not owe fiduciary duties just by holding a membership interest. Members can ratify managers’ actions that would otherwise breach the duty of loyalty with informed approval. Regardless of structure, all members and managers must act in good faith and with fair dealing in performing and enforcing the operating agreement, and this contractual obligation generally cannot be waived outright, though it may be defined in the agreement within statutory limits.",
      "hardContent": "In a member-managed LLC, all members function similarly to partners and therefore owe traditional fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the LLC and to one another. In a manager-managed LLC, however, management authority is centralized in designated managers, and those managers owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty comparable to corporate directors or general partners; non-managing members ordinarily do not owe such duties merely as passive owners. Acts by managers that would otherwise constitute a breach of the duty of loyalty—such as self-dealing or usurping LLC opportunities—can often be cleansed by informed ratification by the members, as permitted by the operating agreement and applicable statute. Separate from fiduciary duties, all members and managers in an LLC are bound by an implied contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of the operating agreement. While the operating agreement may specify how good faith and fair dealing apply in particular contexts, most LLC statutes provide that this obligation cannot be completely eliminated.",

This power to bind can arise through three main bases: 1. Actual authority. 2. Apparent authority. 3. Ratification. To analyze whether a principal is bound by an agent’s contract with a third party, apply a structured sequence: 1. Ask whether the agent had actual authority. 2.

When determining whether a principal is bound by an alleged agent’s contract with a third party, follow a structured approach: first ask whether the agent had actual authority; if not, examine whether the agent had apparent authority; and if neither actual nor apparent authority is present, ask whether the principal nevertheless became bound by ratifying the agent’s unauthorized conduct.

Common elements of intentional torts 1.1 Act by D: some volitional movement. 1.2 Intent: either specific intent (to bring about a specific harm) or general intent (knowledge with substantial certainty that the tortious result will occur). 1.3 Causation: D's conduct must be a substantial factor in bringing about the resulting harm. 1.4 Damages: compensatory damages are generally available, and punitive damages may be awarded for malicious conduct. 2. Transferred intent doctrine (special rule) 2.1 When D intends one classic intentional tort (assault, battery, false imprisonment, or trespass) but ends up harming a different person and/or committing a different one of those torts, D's original intent transfers to the actual victim and tort. These shared elements and the transferred intent doctrine form the backbone of the classic intentional torts.",

Overlaying these elements is the transferred intent doctrine, which applies to the classic intentional torts of assault, battery, false imprisonment, and trespass, and allows D's intent to commit one of these torts against one person to transfer when a different person and/or a different one of these torts is actually committed.",

Comparative negligence - Plaintiff’s own negligence reduces, rather than completely bars, recovery. - Fact-finder assigns percentages of fault to plaintiff and defendant and reduces plaintiff’s damages by plaintiff’s share. - Systems include partial (modified) comparative negligence, which cuts off recovery once plaintiff’s fault reaches a jurisdictional threshold, and pure comparative negligence, which allows recovery regardless of plaintiff’s percentage of fault. 2. Contributory negligence - In a few jurisdictions, any negligence by the plaintiff that contributes to her injury can bar recovery entirely. - The harshness of this rule is mitigated by the last clear chance doctrine, which lets the plaintiff recover if the defendant had the final clear opportunity to avoid the accident. 3. Assumption of risk (including express assumption) - Applies when the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily faces a specific risk, which can bar or limit recovery. - Assumption of risk can be implied from conduct or expressly agreed to (e.g., in an exculpatory clause), though courts scrutinize such agreements, especially in adhesion contracts. - These defenses generally do not apply to intentional torts, though the plaintiff may consent to intentional tortious conduct.",

In partial (modified) comparative systems, recovery is permitted only if the plaintiff’s negligence is below (or at most equal to) a jurisdictional cutoff (often 50%), while in pure systems, the plaintiff may recover regardless of his percentage of fault. Contributory negligence, a minority rule, bars recovery entirely if plaintiff’s negligence contributed to the injury, but the last clear chance doctrine allows recovery if, after plaintiff was in peril, the defendant had the final clear opportunity to avoid the accident and failed to do so. Assumption of risk bars or limits recovery when the defendant proves that the plaintiff knew of a specific risk and voluntarily proceeded in the face of that risk; this may be implied from circumstances or express via an agreement such as an exculpatory clause, which is less likely to be enforced when it is part of an adhesion contract.

Partners in a partnership: each partner is vicariously liable for other partners’ torts committed within the scope of the partnership business. 2.4. Parent–child: no vicarious liability for children’s torts, but parents may be directly negligent based on knowledge of dangerous propensities or facilitation of the tort. 2.5. Tavernkeepers (dram shop-type liability): businesses serving alcohol may be liable to third parties injured by intoxicated patrons when the business is negligent in serving. 3.

Additionally, an initial aggressor generally cannot invoke self-defense.

Damages (at Common Law) 2.1 The plaintiff's burden of proving damages depends on: (a) the type of plaintiff (public official/figure vs. private figure); (b) whether the statement involves a matter of public concern; and (c) whether the defamation is libel, slander, or slander per se. 2.2 Historically, some forms of libel and slander per se allowed presumed damages, while other types of slander required proof of special damages, subject to modern constitutional limits. 3.

Truth as a Defense 3.1 {{c26::Truth}} is a {{c27::complete defense}} to defamation. 3.2 If the defendant establishes that the {{c28::gist or sting}} of the statement is true, the plaintiff cannot recover for defamation, even if the statement is slightly inaccurate in detail.",
      "easyContent": "Defamation law always involves falsity and fault, though modern constitutional rules determine who must prove them and at what level (e.g., negligence or actual malice). The plaintiff’s need to prove damages depends on the type of plaintiff, whether the matter is of public concern, and whether the claim is libel, slander, or slander per se. Truth is a complete defense if the gist of the statement is true.",
      "mediumContent": "Under common law, a plaintiff did not have to prove fault, but modern First Amendment doctrine usually requires some level of fault and often places the burden of proving falsity on the plaintiff, particularly for public officials/figures or matters of public concern. The damages framework varies with the type of plaintiff, whether the subject is of public concern, and whether the defamation is libel, slander, or slander per se; historically, libel and slander per se allowed presumed damages, while other slander required proof of special damages, all now subject to constitutional constraints. Truth is a complete defense if the defendant can show that the gist or sting of the statement is true.",
      "hardContent": "Falsity and fault are always central to defamation. At common law, the plaintiff did not have to prove fault, but modern constitutional doctrine—primarily under the First Amendment—imposes fault requirements in many cases and allocates the burden of proving falsity or truth. For public officials and public figures, and often when speech involves a matter of public concern, the plaintiff typically must prove falsity and a heightened fault standard (such as actual malice), while in other contexts the defendant may bear the burden of proving truth or the plaintiff may only need to show negligence. The plaintiff’s damages burden depends on the type of plaintiff, whether the subject is of public concern, and whether the defamation is classified as libel, slander, or slander per se. Historically, libel and slander per se allowed presumed general damages, whereas other forms of slander required the plaintiff to prove special damages, though these rules are modified by constitutional limitations. Truth is a complete defense to defamation; if the defendant establishes that the gist or sting of the statement is substantially true, minor inaccuracies will not defeat the defense and the plaintiff cannot recover.",

The most frequently tested examples are: (1) erroneous communication that a close relative has died, and (2) mishandling of a corpse, such as losing, mutilating, or otherwise desecrating the body of a loved one.

The most common doctrine is respondeat superior: an employer is vicariously liable for an employee’s torts committed within the scope of employment. Scope typically means conduct of the kind the employee is hired to perform, occurring within authorized time and space limits, and at least partly motivated by a purpose to serve the employer. The key exam moves are to distinguish employees from independent contractors and analyze whether the tortious conduct fits within this scope test.",

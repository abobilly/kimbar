The court starts with a presumption that the forum’s law should apply. It then examines the policies behind the forum’s law and those of any other involved state, assessing whether each state has a legitimate governmental interest in applying its law to the dispute. If another forum has an interest and the forum does not, the court will typically apply the other forum’s law; if both do, it may apply forum law or a modified rule that accounts for both sets of interests. This analysis does not change based on the area of law; on an exam, you should explicitly analyze each forum’s interest in having its law applied on the given facts.",

      "backPlain": "Ex Parte vs. Consent Divorces and Domicile: 1. Ex Parte Divorce (One-Spouse Domicile/Appearance): 1.1 Definition: A divorce where only one spouse appears and the decree is based on that spouse’s domicile in the rendering state. 1.2 Domicile Inquiry: - The enforcing state may examine whether the rendering spouse’s claimed domicile in the divorcing state was bona fide. - There is a rebuttable presumption that the spouse’s domicile as found by the rendering court is genuine. 1.3 Recognition Consequence: - If domicile was genuine and jurisdiction proper, the decree must be given full faith and credit as to marital status. 2. Consent Divorce (Both Spouses Participate): 2.1 Definition: A divorce where both spouses appear (often by personal appearance or valid consent) before the rendering court. 2.2 Jurisdiction and Domicile: - Full faith and credit will be given if the rendering court had proper jurisdiction. - Jurisdiction will be found when at least one spouse is domiciled in the forum; if both are properly domiciled, jurisdiction is especially secure. 2.3 Recognition Consequence: - Other states must generally recognize the decree and may not collaterally attack jurisdiction as easily as in an ex parte divorce. 3. Key Contrast: 3.1 Ex parte divorces are more vulnerable to collateral attacks on domicile and jurisdiction in the enforcing state. 3.2 Consent divorces, with both spouses present and at least one domiciled in the forum, receive stronger full faith and credit protection.",

      "easyContent": "In ex parte divorces, only one spouse appears and the enforcing state can reexamine whether that spouse’s domicile in the rendering state was real, though domicile is presumed bona fide. In consent divorces, both spouses appear and if at least one is domiciled in the forum, jurisdiction is strong and other states must generally honor the decree.",
      "mediumContent": "An ex parte divorce is granted when only one spouse appears before the rendering court, typically based on that spouse’s domicile. The enforcing state may reexamine whether that domicile was genuine, although the rendering court’s domicile finding is presumed correct but rebuttable. A consent divorce occurs when both spouses participate in the proceeding; if at least one spouse is domiciled in the forum, jurisdiction exists and other states must generally give full faith and credit. Ex parte decrees are thus more susceptible to collateral jurisdictional attack than consent decrees.",
      "hardContent": "Ex parte divorces and consent divorces differ in how easily other states may challenge the rendering court’s jurisdiction. An ex parte divorce is granted on the basis of only one spouse’s appearance and alleged domicile in the rendering state. While domicile provides the jurisdictional hook for the decree, an enforcing state is permitted to inquire into whether that domicile was bona fide, despite a rebuttable presumption favoring the rendering court’s domicile determination. By contrast, a consent divorce involves both spouses appearing or consenting to the jurisdiction of the rendering court. Where at least one spouse is domiciled in the forum (and especially when both are domiciled there), jurisdiction is secure, and sister states must give the decree full faith and credit with far less room to collaterally attack the jurisdictional basis. Thus, ex parte divorces are more vulnerable to challenges on domicile and jurisdiction than consent divorces.",

Continuing Jurisdiction and Modification: 3.1 The court that made the original custody decree retains exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over custody. 3.2 No other state may modify that custody determination unless: - The original court determines that it no longer has a significant connection with the child or the parties; or - The original court otherwise relinquishes or loses jurisdiction under the statute (e.g., everyone has moved out of the state). 4.

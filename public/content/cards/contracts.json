Courts apply a reasonable person standard to separate true offers from mere preliminaries or negotiations, and most advertisements are treated as invitations to deal rather than offers unless they are highly specific and clearly identify who may accept. Under UCC Article 2, the critical requirement is a certain or ascertainable quantity term; in requirement and output contracts, unreasonably disproportionate increases in quantity are barred.

It terminates the offer and the offeree’s power of acceptance and is effective only upon receipt; once accepted, an offer can no longer be revoked. Offers can be made irrevocable in several ways: (1) unilateral contracts become irrevocable for a reasonable time once performance (beyond mere preparation) begins; (2) option contracts supported by consideration; (3) UCC firm offers—merchant’s signed writings assuring the offer will be held open, irrevocable for the time stated or up to three months if none is stated; and (4) reasonable detrimental reliance by the offeree.",

Several doctrines restrict revocation by making offers irrevocable: (a) in unilateral contracts, the offeree’s commencement of performance (beyond mere preparation) renders the offer irrevocable for a reasonable time to complete performance; (b) an option contract—a separate promise to keep an offer open—must be supported by consideration at common law and under the UCC when the firm-offer rule does not apply; (c) a UCC firm offer arises when a merchant makes an offer in a signed writing that gives assurances it will be held open, making it irrevocable for the time stated, or if none is stated, for a reasonable time not exceeding three months; and (d) reasonable and detrimental reliance by the offeree can render an offer irrevocable.",

Consideration is a required element of every contract: the promise must induce the detriment, and the detriment must induce the promise. 2. Detriment and Pre-Existing Duty 2.1. Detriment is an obligation to do or refrain from doing something one would otherwise not be obligated to do or refrain from doing. 2.2. Pre-existing duty: A promise to perform a pre-existing duty or obligation generally does not constitute consideration. 2.3. Exception: A promise to pay a debt after the statute of limitations has run is binding despite lack of new consideration. 3. Invalid Consideration 3.1. The following do not constitute consideration: 3.1.1. Promises of gifts or conditional gifts (where the condition is merely a way to receive the gift). 3.1.2. Illusory promises: a promise where there is no real obligation to perform (for example, \"I will do your chores if I feel like it\" or \"if I have time\"). 4. Promissory Estoppel (Reliance) 4.1. Courts may enforce a promise without consideration under promissory estoppel if: 4.1.1. The promisor reasonably expects reliance by the promisee; 4.1.2. The promisee acts or refrains from acting in detrimental reliance; and 4.1.3. Injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.",

Gifts, conditional gifts, illusory promises, and mere pre-existing duties are not valid consideration, but promissory estoppel can enforce certain relied-upon promises even without consideration.",
      "mediumContent": "Consideration exists when there is a bargained-for exchange of legal value—either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee—and the promise induces the detriment while the detriment induces the promise. Detriment means doing or forbearing something one is not otherwise legally obligated to do or forbear. A promise to perform a pre-existing duty is ordinarily not consideration, although a promise to pay a debt after the statute of limitations has run is enforceable without new consideration. Promises of gifts or conditional gifts (where the condition is just a way to receive the gift) and illusory promises where the promisor has no real obligation to perform do not qualify as consideration. However, under promissory estoppel, a promise can be enforced if the promisor reasonably expects reliance, the promisee actually relies to their detriment, and only enforcement will avoid injustice.",

It exists where there is either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee, and the promise and detriment mutually induce each other. Detriment means taking on an obligation to do or refrain from doing something that one has no prior legal duty to do or refrain from doing. A promise to perform a pre-existing legal duty generally is not consideration, because it adds nothing of legal value; an important exception is that a written promise to pay a debt after the statute of limitations has expired is binding even without new consideration. Invalid forms of consideration include promises of gifts or conditional gifts when the condition is only a means of taking delivery, and illusory promises where the promisor retains unfettered discretion whether to perform (e.g., \"if I feel like it\" or \"if I have time\"). As a substitute, courts may invoke promissory estoppel to enforce a promise without consideration when the promisor reasonably expects the promisee to rely, the promisee actually relies by acting or refraining from acting to their detriment, and only enforcement of the promise will prevent injustice.",

Statute of Frauds (SoF) – certain types of contracts must satisfy specific formal (usually writing and signature) requirements; failure to comply makes the contract unenforceable. 3. Illegality – the subject matter or purpose of the contract is illegal or contrary to public policy. 4. Misrepresentation/Fraud – the agreement is induced by fraudulent or materially misleading statements. 5. Duress – the agreement is induced by wrongful threats, force, or coercive pressure. 6. Unconscionability – the terms or bargaining process are so unfair or oppressive that enforcement would be unjust. 7. Misunderstanding – there is ambiguity concerning a term, and the parties attach materially different meanings. 8. Mistake – one or both parties are mistaken about underlying facts that are material to the bargain.

(2) Misrepresentation (fraud): false assertions, concealment, or misstatements about a material fact before formation or performance that a party reasonably and detrimentally relies on, making the contract voidable. (3) Undue influence: a contract entered into under excessive pressure by a party unduly susceptible to such pressure, making the contract voidable. (4) Duress: a wrongful act or threat that overcomes a party’s free will; physical duress renders the contract void, while non-physical duress makes it voidable at the option of the coerced party. (5) Unconscionability: where the bargaining process or contract terms are so unfair or oppressive (often seen in adhesion contracts or exculpatory clauses for intentional acts, especially where the disadvantaged party has no meaningful choice) that a court may refuse to enforce all or part of the contract.",

Courts look to purpose and intent, and the protected party can waive or lose the right to insist on the condition; some doctrines like breach or wrongful prevention can excuse a condition.",
      "mediumContent": "Conditions are agreed limits on performance that make a party’s duty contingent on some event, often signaled by words like “if,” “provided that,” or “on condition that.” Nonoccurrence of a condition means the related duty does not arise or is discharged, whereas nonperformance of a promise is a breach with damages. Conditions may be express or implied and are commonly divided into conditions precedent (must occur before performance is due) and conditions subsequent (occur after performance has begun and excuse the duty going forward). Courts interpret conditions based on their purpose and the parties’ intent, often to protect a specific party; that party can waive the condition or be estopped from enforcing it. Conditions can also be excused by breach, anticipatory repudiation, waiver, or wrongful prevention or hindrance of the condition’s occurrence.",
      "hardContent": "In contract law, a condition is an agreed-upon limitation on performance that makes a party's duty contingent on the occurrence of some event, commonly signaled by language such as “if,” “provided that,” or “on condition that.” The critical distinction is that failure of a promise constitutes a breach with damages, whereas failure of a condition means the related performance obligation does not arise or is discharged. Conditions can be express or implied and are typically grouped by timing into conditions precedent—events that must occur before performance is due, such that nonoccurrence excuses performance—and conditions subsequent—events that occur after performance has begun and, when they occur, terminate the duty to continue performing. Courts interpret conditions in light of their purpose and the parties’ intent, often construing them to protect a particular party; that protected party can waive the condition or be estopped from insisting on its enforcement. In addition, conditions may be excused by doctrines such as breach, anticipatory repudiation, waiver, or wrongful prevention or hindrance of the condition’s occurrence, in which case the condition may be treated as satisfied and the duty remains.",

A modification is a subsequent change to the terms of an existing contract: the parties agree to discharge the original terms in favor of new ones, but the contract itself generally remains in place unless they clearly intend to discharge it entirely. At common law, modification requires mutual assent and consideration, typically found because each party limits rights under the original contract; under the modern trend, some courts enforce a fair modification prompted by unanticipated circumstances without new consideration. For contracts for the sale of goods, UCC Article 2 allows good‑faith modifications without consideration but may require a writing if the contract as modified falls within the Statute of Frauds or if the original agreement requires modifications to be in writing; parol evidence is admissible to prove such subsequent modifications. A novation is a new contract that substitutes a new party for an original party: it requires (1) a prior valid contract, (2) agreement of all parties, including the new party, to a new contract, (3) extinguishment of contractual duties between the original parties, and (4) a new valid and enforceable contract.

Requirement and output contracts: 2.1. Quantity may be measured by the buyer’s requirements or the seller’s output. 2.2. The chosen quantity must be in good faith. 2.3. There may be no unreasonably disproportionate increase in quantity compared to any stated estimate or prior course of performance. 3. Missing or open terms under the UCC: 3.1. The UCC is liberal in enforcing contracts despite missing terms. 3.2. Price and other terms can be left open if: 3.2.1. The parties clearly intended to make a contract; and 3.2.2. There is a reasonably certain basis for giving a remedy (e.g., UCC gap-filler provisions). 3.3. Courts will use UCC gap-fillers for price, time, and place of delivery when appropriate, but will not supply quantity except in requirement or output contracts.",
      "frontPrompt": "What special rules govern offers for the sale of goods under UCC Article 2 regarding quantity, requirement/output contracts, and missing terms?",
      "cloze": "Under {{c1::UCC Article 2}}, an offer for the sale of goods generally must have a {{c2::certain or ascertainable quantity term}}. In {{c3::requirement}} and {{c4::output}} contracts, quantity is measured by the buyer’s requirements or seller’s output, but any increase must be in {{c5::good faith}} and cannot be {{c6::unreasonably disproportionate}} to a stated estimate or prior dealings. The UCC allows many {{c7::missing or open terms}}—especially {{c8::price}}—if the parties {{c9::intended to make a contract}} and there is a {{c10::reasonably certain basis for giving a remedy}} using {{c11::gap-filler provisions}}. However, courts generally {{c12::will not supply a quantity term}} beyond requirement or output structures.",
      "easyContent": "In UCC sales of goods, quantity is the crucial term: it must be fixed or at least capable of being determined, including via requirement or output contracts. The UCC lets many other terms like price be left open, using gap-fillers, as long as the parties clearly intended a contract and a court can craft a remedy.",
      "mediumContent": "Under UCC Article 2, an enforceable offer for the sale of goods usually requires a certain or ascertainable quantity term. This can be set by requirement or output contracts, where the quantity is the buyer’s needs or the seller’s production, subject to good faith and a bar on unreasonably disproportionate increases from any estimate or prior performance. Unlike common law, the UCC tolerates missing terms such as price, time, and delivery, and supplies them through gap-fillers, so long as the parties intended to contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy; courts will not, however, create a quantity term out of whole cloth.",
      "hardContent": "UCC Article 2 modifies common-law offer rules by focusing on quantity as the essential term for contracts for the sale of goods. An offer must include a certain or ascertainable quantity term, but quantity may be defined functionally through requirement and output contracts, in which the quantity is based on the buyer’s actual requirements or the seller’s actual output. These quantities must be demanded or tendered in good faith, and the UCC prohibits quantities that are unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or prior course of performance, protecting parties from opportunistic behavior. The UCC is otherwise liberal regarding missing terms: a contract is not invalid simply because price, time, or place of delivery is left open. If the parties manifest an intent to contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy, courts will employ the UCC’s gap-filler provisions to supply these missing terms. However, courts are generally unwilling to supply a missing quantity term on their own, except where quantity is inherently defined by a requirement or output structure.",

Types - Procedural unconscionability: Problems with the bargaining process, such as: • Oppression (e.g., unequal bargaining power, no meaningful choice); • Surprise (e.g., hidden terms, fine print, complex legalese). - Substantive unconscionability: Unfair or one-sided terms, such as: • Grossly excessive price or harsh allocation of risks; • One-sided remedies or waivers. 3. Standard - Many courts require some degree of both procedural and substantive unconscionability, though a strong showing of one can sometimes compensate for a lesser showing of the other. - The determination is typically made as of the time of contract formation, not in hindsight. 4.

Many jurisdictions apply a sliding scale, requiring some showing of both procedural and substantive unconscionability, but a strong showing of one can offset a weaker showing of the other.

First, a disclaimer can limit or eliminate implied warranties, but it generally cannot disclaim express warranties that have already been created.

Such remedy limitations are generally enforceable for all warranties unless they are unconscionable or operate so narrowly that they fail of their essential purpose, in which case broader remedies may be available.

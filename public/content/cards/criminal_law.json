Strict liability – no mens rea requirement at all for the offense (e.g., certain statutory rape, regulatory, or morality crimes). 5.

      "hardContent": "For temporal and liability purposes, conspiracy ends either when the target crime is successfully completed or when the conspirators truly abandon their plan. Impossibility does not excuse conspiratorial liability; the law punishes the agreement and danger of group criminality even if, unknown to the parties, the crime cannot be completed. Once the elements of conspiracy are satisfied—the agreement plus the requisite intents, and, in overt-act jurisdictions, the overt act—the crime of conspiracy is complete, and subsequent withdrawal cannot undo it. Nevertheless, a conspirator who effectively withdraws (often by communicating withdrawal to co-conspirators and, in some jurisdictions, taking affirmative steps to thwart the crime) before further crimes are committed may avoid vicarious liability for those later substantive offenses. Thus, withdrawal functions primarily to cut off liability for co-conspirators' subsequent crimes, not to negate the conspiracy itself.",

Lost or misplaced property - Larceny occurs when a defendant finds lost or misplaced property and decides to keep it if: • The true owner is known or reasonably ascertainable at the time of finding, and • The defendant intends to permanently deprive that owner. 2. Abandoned property - Property that is truly abandoned (the owner has intentionally relinquished all rights) cannot be the subject of larceny. 3. Key distinction - The focus is on whether there is a reasonably identifiable owner at the time of the taking. If so, and the finder keeps the item with intent to permanently deprive, this can satisfy the taking and intent elements of larceny for found property.",

In contrast, property that has been truly abandoned—where the prior owner has intentionally given up all rights—cannot be the subject of larceny.",
      "hardContent": "Found-property situations are treated specially in larceny law. If a defendant finds lost or misplaced property and, at the time of taking, knows or can reasonably ascertain the identity of the true owner, the defendant's decision to keep the property with intent to permanently deprive satisfies larceny's taking and intent requirements. The law focuses on whether, at the time of the taking, there is a reasonably identifiable owner. By contrast, truly abandoned property—where the prior owner has intentionally relinquished all rights and claims—cannot be the subject of larceny. Because there is no true owner in such cases, keeping abandoned property does not constitute larceny, even if the finder intends to keep it permanently.",

# ChatGPT Pixel Art Props - Round 2

Great work on the first batch! The scales, quill, and document look perfect. Now I need a few more courthouse/legal props in the exact same style.

## Same Style Rules (Reminder)
- **LPC pixel art style** - top-down 3/4 RPG view
- **1-pixel dark outline** around all shapes
- **Limited palette** - 12-20 colors max per sprite
- **NO anti-aliasing** - hard pixel edges only
- **Transparent background** (PNG)
- Match the style of the scales/quill you just made
